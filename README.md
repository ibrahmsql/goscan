## Wordlists

GoScan comes with 13 specialized wordlists for different scanning scenarios:

### Core Wordlists
- **`wordlist.txt`** - General purpose directory and file names
- **`bigwordlist.txt`** - Extended general purpose wordlist
- **`comprehensive-2025.txt`** - Modern comprehensive wordlist

### Technology-Specific Wordlists
- **`web-technologies.txt`** - Popular web frameworks and CMS paths
- **`cms-frameworks.txt`** - Detailed CMS and framework specific paths
- **`api-endpoints.txt`** - Modern API endpoints and services
- **`database-paths.txt`** - Database and data storage related paths

### Security-Focused Wordlists
- **`security-testing.txt`** - Penetration testing and security audit paths
- **`sensitive-files.txt`** - Configuration files, credentials, and security files
- **`backup-temp-files.txt`** - Backup files and temporary file patterns

### Infrastructure Wordlists
- **`server-infrastructure.txt`** - Server and infrastructure related paths
- **`common-web-paths.txt`** - Common web application paths and endpoints
- **`file-extensions.txt`** - Comprehensive file extensions collection

## Examples

### Security Testing

```bash
# Scan for sensitive files
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/sensitive-files.txt

# Look for backup files
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/backup-temp-files.txt

# Security-focused scanning
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/security-testing.txt
```

### CMS Detection

```bash
# Scan for CMS and framework files
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/cms-frameworks.txt

# Web technology detection
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/web-technologies.txt
```

### API Discovery

```bash
# Discover API endpoints
./goscan -u https://api.target.com -w wordlists/api-endpoints.txt

# Database path discovery
./goscan -u https://target.com -w wordlists/database-paths.txt
```

## Output Formats

### Text Output (Default)
```
[200] https://example.com/admin/
[301] https://example.com/login -> https://example.com/login/
[403] https://example.com/config/
```

### JSON Output
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/admin/",
  "status_code": 200,
  "content_length": 1234,
  "redirect_url": ""
}
```

### CSV Output
```csv
URL,Status Code,Content Length,Redirect URL
https://example.com/admin/,200,1234,
https://example.com/login,301,0,https://example.com/login/
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Adjust Thread Count**: Start with 20 threads and increase based on target capacity
2. **Use Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming the target server with `-r` option
3. **Filter Responses**: Use `-mc` or `-fc` to focus on relevant status codes
4. **Choose Appropriate Wordlists**: Use specific wordlists for targeted scanning
5. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Watch CPU and memory usage during large scans

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: Ensure you have permission to scan the target
- **Rate Limiting**: Use appropriate delays to avoid DoS conditions
- **Proxy Usage**: Consider using proxies for anonymity when appropriate
- **SSL Verification**: Only use `-k` flag when necessary for testing
